# Building Recurrent Neural Nets, Gated Recurrent Unit and Long-Short term memory networks.

This is a simple neural network built in Go.  It is further discussed [here](http://www.datadan.io/building-a-neural-net-from-scratch-in-go/) and in [Machine Learning with Go](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-go).
